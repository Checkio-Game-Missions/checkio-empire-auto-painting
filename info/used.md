**How it is used:**

This is similar to trying to cook three steaks in one frying pan.
Each steak has two sides and it takes a minute to cook one side of two steaks, so
how would you cook each of the steaks in three minutes?
This task takes the concept,  but models it in a technical way.
This is a technological process which you often find in a factories where certain goods must be made with precision timing.
