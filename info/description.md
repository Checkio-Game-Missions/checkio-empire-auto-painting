For each step the system can paint only one side of an item.
After that, an operator must reload the machine and paint the other side. The system will detect painted sides automatically.
The painting process always takes the same length of of time to complete and K surfaces may be painted at a time.

You should write a program which will allow us to paint N (0 < N â‰¤ 10) surfaces in the shortest possible timeframe.
Be careful that you don't paint the same item more than twice.

Items are numbered from 0 to 9.
You are given the paint holding capacity of the machine (K) and the quantity of items (N).
You should return the sequence  which needs painting as a string where each action is the number of painted items. 
Actions separated by comma (",").

In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible.
The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
